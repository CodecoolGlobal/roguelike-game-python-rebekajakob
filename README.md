# Roguelike game in python
### About the game
This is our first big project at Codecool, with 10 weeks of programming experience behind our back.

It's a turn based terminal game in python. It has 3 levels, where you have to fight enemies, collect coins, and try to keep your health in the positives.

You can move using WASD, moving over items picks them up, but healing items can't be picked, when your health is full.

Colliding with monsters takes hp from both them and the player
